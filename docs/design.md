# Design

## User Interface design
This wireframe acts as a detailed blueprint for my EV charging point application, giving a clear picture of the user experience even before we dive into development. It highlights essential features like a search bar, dropdown menus, and action buttons that help users find charging stations, check prices, and explore various EV models. The map integration makes it super user-friendly by letting users see charging locations at a glance, while the reporting feature allows them to flag any issues, ensuring the information stays accurate and current. Plus, the table layout for charge percentage, location, and price makes it easy to compare options, which helps users make better decisions. By creating this wireframe early on, I can foresee design challenges, streamline functionality, and boost the user experience, reducing the chances of major revisions down the line. This organized approach guarantees that the final product is intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient, serving as a solid guide for developing a well-structured EV charging application.
