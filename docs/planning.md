# Project Proposal

## Business Case 

This report presents the necessity of creating an application to help users locate electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in a timely and efficient manner. With electric cars gaining popularity and the automotive industry moving towards a 2030 timeline where electric cars will be fully electric, there is a clear need for a safe way to enable drivers to locate the most suitable charging stations. This proposal presents a well-structured plan, which includes identification of the key challenges, business advantages, potential risks, and project extent. A rigorous planning strategy is required to ensure the efficiency of the app and prevent implementation issues.

### Problem statement

The primary problem our app attempts to address is the problem EV owners face when locating appropriate charging stations. As more people adopt EVs, there is a growing necessity to effectively find charging stations that are available and compatible with the user's vehicle. This app will simplify the process for users to locate the nearest, most convenient charging stations, allowing them to proceed on their journey without undue delays. Considering EVs will become standard for every new car by 2030, this app will be an essential resource for future drivers.

### Business benefits
1)Knowing the importance of the app is paramount for its success. The following are the fundamental advantages of the app:
2)Proximity Alerts: Customers will be able to identify the closest charging stations, saving them time and routes.
3)Vehicle Compatibility: The app will help users find charging stations that are compatible with their specific model of electric vehicle.
4)Real-time Availability: The app will also show the availability status of every charging point, so users are aware if they are available or not.
5)Cost Transparency: The app will inform users if a charging station is charged, allowing them to prepare accordingly.
6)Trip Planning: Users can plan extended trips by identifying charging stations along the way, so there is uninterrupted travel.
7)These functionalities are designed to provide users with a convenient and seamless experience when looking for charging points.

## Alternatives Considered
Some alternatives were also considered during the planning phase to ensure the app offers the best solutions:

Analysis of Current Competitors: We went through competing applications available in the market in order to understand their weaknesses and strengths so that we can create a more friendly app.

Charging Compatibility: One must make sure the app is compatible with all models of major EVs so that people can find compatible stations for their vehicle.

Availability of Charging Stations: Real-time charging point availability and usage data is needed in order to optimize efficiency.

Cost Information: Providing transparent information on any charges for the use of a station will avoid surprising the users.

Reservation Feature: Users might appreciate booking a charging place in advance, especially in busy locations.

##Potential Risks
A set of risks is needed for the successful execution of the project:

Charging Infrastructure Insufficiency: With increased EV consumers, the demand for charge stations might exceed the supply, and stations might get congested.

Home Charging Preference: Users may choose to charge their cars at home rather than use public charging stations, resulting in reduced app usage.

Cybersecurity Risks: The app can be vulnerable to hacking or data loss, undermining user information and privacy.

##P roject Scope
The creation of the mobile app, its integration with the key data sources, and its communication with other systems, such as maps and payment systems, is what the project will focus on. Key aspects are as follows:

App Development: The main user interface will be in the shape of a mobile app.

Data Integration: The mobile app will be integrated with publicly available data, such as Bristol's open data for station locations.

Payment and Mapping Features: The software will offer a unified experience to the users to see station places and pay for charging if it is required. 

These functions will support each other to let the app perform effectively, and that will serve the EV owners as they will get real-time information and minimize the time while searching for ideal charging stations.
