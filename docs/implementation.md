# Implementation

## Introduction
The Bristol Open Data implementation is used to use charging information for electric vehicles. Finding charging stations is made simple by the useful information it offers. It contains precise information such as the charger's manufacturer, exact location, and whether or not it is in a public parking lot. Although the dataset is generally accurate and dependable, it may still contain mistakes or out-of-date information. Daily checks and adjustments to guarantee data accuracy can eliminate the problem. We integrated a Bristol Open Data API to facilitate information retrieval and guarantee seamless access to third-party services. In the case of charging stations, the user interface has been designed to guarantee a seamless, easy, and enjoyable experience for the user.

## Use case
## Project Structure 
This is the folder organisation structure for our project, and it is required for many reasons. For example, a higher level of comprehension and effective organisation are two of the main advantages of employing an organised file structure. Team members can easily understand the project with a clearly defined folder structure, which guarantees clarity throughout the project by letting everyone know where to find particular files or resources.

    └── index.html
    └── Maps.html
    └── Script.html
    └── Search.html
    └── style.css
The project directory contains the necessary EV charging platform files: style.css for web design management, index.html for the home page, Maps.html for station location display, Script.html for interactive functionality, and Search.html for station search.

## Software Architecture

 For this project is a structured to be modular, featuring distinct components for both the frontend and backend. For the frontend, we utilize HTML to organize the content, CSS to enhance its visual appeal, and JavaScript to introduce interactivity. This combination significantly influences the user experience and dictates the overall appearance and functionality of the application.

On the backend, we obtain real-time data regarding EV charging stations from the Bristol Open Data API, ensuring that the information we present is both precise and current.

The project is based on a client-server architecture, where the user interface (client) interacts with the server (the API) to access and display pertinent data. Thanks to the modular design, updating either the frontend or backend to incorporate new features or data is a straightforward process.

**1.Front end layer:**

A central hub displaying charging station status, availability and user account information.

Map Interface: Interactive map showing the locations of charging stations and real-time availability.

Charging Session Control: Interface for initiating, monitoring and managing charging sessions.

Profile Management: User profiles for personalized settings, payment methodsand usage history.

**2.Analytic and reporting:**

Collecting usage statistics and performance metrics.

Generating reports on charging station utilization.


## Architectural style

**Microservices:**

The microservice architecture is the perfect architecture for large-scale applications with complex requirements, high needs for scalability and development distributed over multiple teams. This enables the team to work on different services independently, therefore allowing easy and quick fixes on the go if needed at any time.


**Event-Driven:**

Respond to charging session charge events to determine usage and to prepare billing.

Notification Services: Create and send alert notifications about a change in the charging state.

Load Balancing Systems: It is a process of optimization of energy distribution, based on real-time charging events.

Data analytics: Analysis of event data for optimization of charging infrastructure and user experience.
